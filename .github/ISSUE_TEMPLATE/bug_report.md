# Submitting a Report

When posting a bug report, ensure your post adheres to the following format:
```
# Summary
<A summary of the issue you're experiencing. The more detail you can provide here, the better!>

# Steps to Reproduce
<The exact sequence of steps needed to reproduce the issue. This is essential for diagnosing the cause of the issue!>

# Expected Result
<What you expect to happen when you follow the reproduction steps in-game.>

# Actual Result
<What actually happens when you follow the reproduction steps in-game.>
```
Replace the text in <angle brackets>, but ensure the header sections are identical to the way they're presented here.⁩

Attaching screenshots along with an affected save file and your error.log file when posting will greatly expedite the bug-fixing process.

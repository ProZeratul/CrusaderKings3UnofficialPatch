This repo contains the code for the mod Crusader Kings 3 Unofficial Patch (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2871648329).

The master branch contains the most up-to-date code from the mod and you can find all the releases in https://github.com/ProZeratul/CrusaderKings3UnofficialPatch/releases

## Compatibility

The current version is currently compatible with 1.15.0
You can find previous version in the releases page

The mod MUST be the first in your mods list, if you have other mods, loading this mod MUST BE at the very top.

=> Because of the nature of this mod, I have to edit base game file, this is the source of many conflict with other mods editing the same files to add content to the game.

=> By loading this one first you are telling the game engine "this mod has a lesser priority if another one edit the same file".

=> This should resolve compatibility issues, BUT you can encounter bugs that sould be fixed by this.

## Localization

- This mod once included other languages, this is not the case anymore and will only fix english version.
- If you are using another language, you may encounter raw key as I had to add new ones here & there.
- If you want to make a localized version of this mod, feel free to do it. the only thing you have to do is to translate the files in the localization\replace\english folder
